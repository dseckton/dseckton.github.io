   <h1>Design - Analysis Assessment</h1>
   <h2>www.w3schools.com</h2>
   <h2>Design Principles</h2>
   <!-- ***********************************************
Each design principle needs three items:
1- The principle's name and the team member responsible for it.
2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed but keep it to one paragraph!

   <h3>Proximity &mdash; Ashley Ray</h3>
   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-proximity.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating proximity in use">
   <p>This shows proximity because the sections on the left side are grouped together because of their similarity in topic. The navigation bar on the top is grouped together because they all take you to a different page where you can learn those specific things. With all of these examples, it would be easy to tell what things pertained to each other even if it was your first time on this site because similar things are grouped together.</p>

   <h3>Alignment &mdash; Daniel Eckton</h3>
   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-alignment.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating alignment in use">
   <p>The alignment being used throuhout the main page on w3schools.com is center alignment. The use of center alignment in this case gives the page a very uniform and clean look. Center alignment in this case is well executed due to the lack of variation in the size of the objects that are being aligned. For example, looking at all the text, you notice that the length of each of the blocks of text are very close to eachother. If there were significantly larger blocks of text, mixed in with the smaller ones, the center alignment might not be as appealing as it is in the case shown.</p>

   <h3>Repetition &mdash; Daniel Eckton
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-repetition.jpg" alt="Screen shot illustrating repetition in use">
   <p>The repetition being used in this section of the webpage highlights the similarity and the consistency of each of the blocks. Each block contains a Title, being Python or jQuery, a description of the title, and then a simple link that leads to a page in which the user can learn more. The repitition of this format, connects all these blocks as one. As does the similarity in the design aspects, such as the typefaces used, as well as the colors and shapes of each of the elements.</p>

   <h3>Contrast &mdash; Justin Lilly</h3>
   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-contrast.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating contrast in use">
   <p>Contrast is the breaking of established patterns. The design principle of contrast is used to make things stand out. In this example, W3Schools, a website that is all about a do-it-yourself teaching model to help people learn to code websites, uses contrast to bring special attention to its "Try it yourself" modules. A floating box with drop-shadow makes it stand out compared to the rest of the content on the page. </p>

   <h3>Typography &mdash; Vova Zhdanov
   </h3>
   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-typography.png" alt="Screen shot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>At W3schools we can see that they are using unique font for the name of the site, it is always the same and you can identify the website by the font. They use this font as branding for their website. </p>

   <img src="analysis/images/w3schools-typography2.png" alt="Screenshot illustrating typography in use">
   <p>w3school is a website for people who want to learn something about coding, and developers of the website did a really good job with typography they are using a font that most of IDE uses for programming. It helps users to find the information they looking for on the page faster.</p>
