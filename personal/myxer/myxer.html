            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I first encountered the <a>CSS Zen Garden</a> project during my Sophomore year of college. I was taking an Advanced CSS course, and the final project for the course was to, as a group, create our own design. The professor added a few extra requirements, so that we could better implement what we had learned throughout the semester. Things like SVGs, utilizing Sass,  While frustrating at times, I really enjoyed taking an existing webpage and completely redesigning it.</p>
            <p>Something that bothered me about the Zen Garden project was my inability to add functionality through Javascript, or alter the HTML in any way. This project of mine is my attempt to build on the idea of having one HTML page and many, many different looks and feels through use of CSS and Javascript.</p>
